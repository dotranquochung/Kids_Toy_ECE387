# Welcome to the Final Project: Implementing Kids Toy!
### **Course:** ECE 387 - Miami University
### **Author:** Hung Do
## Introduction to the Project
### Project Idea
- By using Arduino Uno Rev 3.0 and various sensors/peripherals, I will implement Google Chrome Dinosaur Game. The difference is that I will implement various ways to play the Chrome Dinosaur Game. By taking used of the sensors/equipment that I current have, I want to make the game much more interesting and interactive.
- I believe Dinosaur Game is attractive and playable for children. It can be implemented in a active way by using EMG Detector (muscle sensor) and Joystick or can be simple using a button.

### Materials and Source
These are the materials needed for the project:
1. x1 Arduino Uno 
2. x1 Bread Board
3. x1 LCD
4. x1 JoyStick
5. x1 Buzzer
6. x1 10k Potentiometer
7. Jumper Wires
8. x1 1k Ohm Resistor
9. x1 Grove EMG Detector kit
10. Button

### Implementation
- All of the version are using LCD as a main display.
- A buzzer serves as a speaker to notify the users when they have failed.
- A random number generator: keep making the objectives different patterns.
- To make the project more interactive, EMG Detector is used. Here is my old project for more details about this sensor: [Github](https://github.com/dotranquochung/Muscle-Sensor/wiki)
 
#### **Version 1: Playing Dinosaur Game with Buttons**
- This version allows users to interact with the Dinosaur using buttons.

#### **Version 2: Playing Dinosaur Game with EMG Detector (Bicep)**
- This version allows users to interact with the Dinosaur using their own muscle to control.
